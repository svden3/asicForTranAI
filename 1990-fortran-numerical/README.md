# 1990 Fortran Numerical Analysis Award Project

## Overview
Award-winning parallel numerical analysis implemented in Fortran (1990). This directory contains the original code that pioneered computational approaches in the early parallel computing era.

## What to Add Here
- **Source Code**: Your original `.f90`, `.f`, or `.for` files
- **Numerical Methods**: Parallel algorithms, matrix operations, numerical solvers
- **Documentation**: Original project documentation, algorithm descriptions
- **Build Scripts**: Makefiles or compilation instructions
- **Results**: Performance benchmarks, accuracy validations

## Historical Context
This work represents early parallel computing approaches in Fortran, demonstrating the foundations that would eventually lead to modern ASIC-accelerated inference 35 years later.

## Getting Started
1. Add your original Fortran source files to `src/`
2. Document the numerical methods used
3. Include any compilation instructions
4. Share performance results from the original hardware
