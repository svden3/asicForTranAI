## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### Common Blockers:

**❌ "I don't know Ada well enough yet"**
✅ **Solution**: You don't need to be an expert. Your AI background is MORE valuable.
   Apply now, learn during interview process. Companies train the right people.

**❌ "I'm too old (45+)"**
✅ **Solution**: Safety-critical industries PREFER experience. Age is an ASSET here.
   You're not competing with bootcamp grads. You're competing with other veterans.

**❌ "My SPARK project isn't impressive enough"**
✅ **Solution**: The IDEA is impressive. "World's first verified 70B" is the hook.
   Even a placeholder GitHub repo shows vision. Ship iteratively.

**❌ "No one is responding to applications"**
✅ **Solution**:
   1. Jobscan your resume (ATS optimization)
   2. Apply Monday 8-10 AM (hiring managers check email then)
   3. Get referrals (email 20 people → 1 interview guaranteed)

## 🎤 Your "Elevator Pitch" (Memorize This)

**30-second version**:
"I've been building neural networks since 1992—before they were 'deep learning.'
Spent 4 years at SGI's legendary AI team in the early 2000s. In November 2025,
I set the world record for 3.5-bit LLM inference: 4188 tokens/sec. Now I'm
bringing that to SPARK 2014 with formal proofs—the first provably-safe LLM
suitable for aviation. I'm looking for roles where AI meets safety-critical systems."

**3-minute version** (interviews):
"My career has three chapters.

First chapter (1992-2000): I was in the first wave of neural networks. Built
commercial NN frameworks when backprop was still exotic. Did three PhD programs
focusing on neural network optimization.

Second chapter (2000-2025): Joined SGI's AI Research Group right as they were
THE platform for high-performance computing and AI. Spent 4 years there, then
21 years in Silicon Valley. Survived two AI winters. Shipped production systems.

Third chapter (2025-now): Last month, I open-sourced the world's first 3.5-bit
quantized 70B inference engine. 4188 tokens per second on a single Groq LPU—
faster than anything else published. But here's the thing: it's all in Python
and Fortran. You can't certify it.

So I'm porting it to SPARK 2014 with complete formal proofs. That's never been
done at this scale. And I think this is the future: AI that's both FAST and
PROVABLY SAFE. That's what excites me about [THIS COMPANY]—you're one of the
few places building that future."
