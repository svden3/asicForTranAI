## 🚀 Tonight's Tasks (2 hours)

### Task 1: Sign Up for vast.ai (10 minutes)
```
1. Visit https://vast.ai/console/signup
2. Create account with email
3. Verify email
4. Add payment method (credit card)
5. Add $50 credit (will only use $12 for Week 3)
6. Get API key from https://vast.ai/console/account/
7. Save API key somewhere safe
```

**Why**: Need account ready to rent GPU Monday morning

---

### Task 2: Test vast.ai CLI Locally (15 minutes)
```bash
# Install vast.ai CLI
pip3 install vastai

# Test search (without renting)
vastai search offers 'gpu_name=MI210' | head -10

# Expected output: List of MI210 instances with prices
# If this works, you're ready for Monday!
```

**Why**: Verify CLI works before Monday

---

### Task 3: Create HackerNews Account (5 minutes)
```
1. Visit https://news.ycombinator.com/
2. Click "login" → "create account"
3. Username: [choose something professional]
4. Password: [strong password]
5. Email: [your email]
6. Verify account
7. Karma: 0 (normal for new accounts)
```

**Why**: Need account to post "Show HN" Week 3 Day 6

---

### Task 4: Prepare GitHub Repository (20 minutes)

**Option A: Create New Public Repo**
```bash
# On GitHub.com
1. Click "New Repository"
2. Name: formally-verified-3p5bit-llama
3. Description: "Formally Verified 3.5-bit LLaMA Quantization (Lean 4 + AlphaProof MCTS + SPARK Ada)"
4. Public: YES (critical for launch)
5. Initialize with README: NO (we have one)

# Locally
git remote add github git@github.com:[username]/formally-verified-3p5bit-llama.git
git push github main
```

**Option B: Make Current Repo Public**
```bash
# If asicForTranAI repo exists but is private:
1. Go to repo settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Change repository visibility"
4. Select "Make public"
5. Confirm
```

**Why**: Need public repo for Week 3 launch

---

### Task 5: Prepare arXiv Account (10 minutes)
```
1. Visit https://arxiv.org/user/register
2. Create account
3. Verify email
4. Apply for endorsement in cs.LG:
   - Go to https://arxiv.org/help/endorsement
   - Request endorsement from colleague with arXiv account
   - Alternative: Submit to cs.LG directly (auto-approved if paper quality is good)
```

**Why**: Need account to submit paper Week 3 Day 5

---

### Task 6: Review HIP Kernel Code (15 minutes)
```bash
# Read the HIP kernel we'll compile Monday
cat docs/WEEK_3_GPU_DEMO_GUIDE.md | grep -A 50 "lib_hip_3p5bit.cpp"

# Questions to answer:
1. Do you understand the decode_3p5bit function?
2. Do you understand the matmul kernel?
3. Any questions about the compilation command?

# If yes to all: You're ready!
# If no: Review Quantization3p5bitProof.lean for context
```

**Why**: Know what you're running before GPU time starts

---

### Task 7: Prepare Social Media Accounts (15 minutes)

**Twitter/X**:
```
1. Ensure account exists
2. Update bio (mention formal verification / AI safety)
3. Follow: @AnthropicAI, @karpathy, @ylecun, @hardmaru
4. Draft first tweet (don't post yet):
   "Excited to share my work on formally verified 3.5-bit
    LLaMA quantization! 🧮

    ✅ 8 theorems proven in Lean 4
    ✅ 95% proof automation via AlphaProof MCTS
    ✅ Real demo on AMD MI210 GPU

    Paper + code coming Monday!"
```

**LinkedIn**:
```
1. Update headline: "AI Safety Researcher | Formal Verification"
2. Add skills: "Lean 4", "Formal Methods", "LLM Quantization"
3. Connect with: AdaCore employees, AMD ROCm team
```

**Reddit**:
```
1. Ensure account has some karma (post a few comments)
2. Join: r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA, r/AMD, r/learnprogramming
3. Read rules for each subreddit
```

**Why**: Need accounts ready to amplify launch

---

### Task 8: Dry Run the Week 3 Kickoff Script (10 minutes)
```bash
# Test the script without actually renting
cd /Users/jimxiao/ai/asicForTranAI

# Read through the script
cat scripts/week3_kickoff.sh

# Verify it's executable
ls -la scripts/week3_kickoff.sh | grep 'x'

# Expected: -rwxr-xr-x (has execute permission)
```

**Why**: Catch any bugs before Monday

---

### Task 9: Prepare Demo Materials Folder (10 minutes)
```bash
# Create folder for Week 3 screenshots
mkdir -p docs/week3_demo

# Create README for demo
cat > docs/week3_demo/README.md << 'EOF'
# Week 3 Demo Materials

- Use a credit card (not debit) for better fraud protection
- Add $50 initially (only $12 will be used)
- Enable 2FA for security

### GitHub Repository
- Choose a clear name: `formally-verified-3p5bit-llama`
- Set topics: `formal-verification`, `lean4`, `llm-quantization`, `alphaproof`
- Add MIT or Apache 2.0 license

### HackerNews Posting
- Best time: Tuesday 8-10 AM PST (Week 3 Day 6)
- Title format: "Show HN: [Project Name] ([Key Tech])"
- First comment: Add context and "Ask me anything!"

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "vast.ai CLI won't install"
```bash
# Try with --user flag
pip3 install --user vastai

# Or use pip instead of pip3
pip install vastai
```

### "GitHub repo creation fails"
```bash
# Use HTTPS instead of SSH
git remote add github https://github.com/[username]/repo.git
```

### "Can't remember if task is done"
```bash
# Just rerun this checklist!
cat docs/PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md
```
