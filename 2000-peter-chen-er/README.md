# 2000 PhD Work Under Prof. Peter Chen

## Overview
PhD research guided by committee chair **Prof. Peter Chen**, father of Entity-Relationship (E-R) modeling and database theory pioneer. This work connects database fundamentals to computational systems.

## What to Add Here
- **Research Notes**: PhD thesis chapters, research papers
- **E-R Models**: Database design artifacts from your work
- **Committee Feedback**: Notes from Prof. Chen and committee
- **Publications**: Conference papers, journal articles
- **Code**: Research prototypes, database implementations

## Historical Context
- **Prof. Peter Chen**: Introduced E-R model (1976), revolutionized database design
- Your PhD work under his guidance connects classical database theory to modern systems
- Foundation for thinking about data structures and relationships

## Key Contributions
Document how your PhD work:
- Applied E-R modeling principles
- Connected to numerical/computational systems
- Influenced your later ASIC and AI work
- Benefited from Prof. Chen's mentorship

## Getting Started
1. Add thesis materials and research papers
2. Include E-R diagrams and database designs
3. Document key insights from Prof. Chen
4. Share how this influenced your AI journey
