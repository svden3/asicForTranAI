## Slide 2: THE PROBLEM - Smart People Make Dumb Decisions

**Headline:** The $50k-500k Opportunity Cost

**Visual:**
- Timeline graphic showing missed opportunities:
  - 2010: "Apple too expensive at $10" → Missed 18× gain
  - 2020: "Bitcoin is dead at $16k" → Missed 6× gain

**Key Stats (large, bold):**
- **4%/year** - How much average investors underperform S&P 500
- **$127,000** - Lost over 30 years on $100k portfolio (compounded)
- **40M Americans** own stocks + crypto but have no behavioral coach

**Bottom Text:**
> "The problem isn't information - it's decision-making.
> Bloomberg won't help you. Robo-advisors are generic. Human advisors cost $10k/year."

**Talking Points:**
- People KNEW Apple/Bitcoin were opportunities, but didn't act (or sold too early)
- Emotional mistakes (FOMO, panic) cost more than fees
- Existing solutions don't address behavioral gap

- 46% smaller models than INT4 (runs on consumer hardware)
- Financial data NEVER leaves user's device (Tier 2)
