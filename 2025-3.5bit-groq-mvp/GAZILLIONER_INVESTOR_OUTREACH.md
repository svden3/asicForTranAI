## Outreach Strategy

### Phase 1: Warm Intro Mapping (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal**: Identify warm paths to every Tier 1 investor

**Tactics**:
1. **LinkedIn Navigator**: Map all employees at YC, a16z, Founders Fund
2. **Alumni Networks**: Stanford, MIT, Harvard → find connections
3. **Portfolio Company Employees**: Reach out to people at Coinbase, Stripe, Robinhood
4. **Advisor Recruitment**: Bring on 1-2 advisors with VC networks

**Warm Intro Template**:
```
Subject: Intro Request - Fintech Founder (Mutual Connection: [Name])

Hi [Name],

I'm building Gazillioner, a gamified financial education platform (think Duolingo for wealth management). We've built the first iPad app with on-device LLaMA for privacy-first financial coaching.

Early traction:
- 250 beta users
- FQ Score system (0-1000, like FICO for financial decision-making)
- $8k MRR (3 months post-launch)
- 42% D30 retention

I'm raising $1M pre-seed and [INVESTOR NAME] is our dream investor because [SPECIFIC REASON].

Would you be open to making an intro? Happy to send a deck or do a quick demo.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### Phase 2: Direct Outreach (Weeks 5-8)

**For investors with NO warm intro**:

**Cold Email Template** (short = better):
```

Gazillioner: Gamified financial education platform
- FQ Score (0-1000) measures financial decision-making ability
- On-device AI coaching (LLaMA-13B on iPad)
- $30/month, 250 users, 42% D30 retention, $8k MRR

We're raising $1M. Interested?

Founder, Gazillioner
[email] | [phone]
```

**Why This Works**:
- Under 100 words (respects their time)
- Clear traction (users, retention, MRR)
- Easy next step (deck link)

---

### Phase 3: Demo Day Preparation (Weeks 9-12)

**If YC W26 batch accepted**:
- YC Demo Day = instant credibility
- 300+ investors in room
- Live demo = show FQ scoring in action

**If NOT in YC**:
- Host virtual demo day (invite 20-30 investors)
- Record demo video (3 min max)
- Distribute via AngelList, Twitter

---

### Phase 4: Negotiation & Close (Weeks 13-16)

**Target Round Structure**:
- Lead investor: $500k-750k (a16z, Founders Fund, Ribbit)
- Follow-on: $250k-500k (Initialized, Craft, First Round)

**Terms**:
- $1M raise at $4-6M post-money valuation

**Key Negotiation Points**:
1. **Valuation**: Justify $4-6M with comparable (Duolingo pre-seed, Robinhood pre-seed)
2. **Investor Rights**: Avoid giving board seat this early

## Investor Meeting Scripts

### The 20-Minute Pitch (Virtual/In-Person)

**Minute 0-2: Hook**
"How much money have you lost to bad financial decisions? Panic selling in March 2020? Forgetting to harvest tax losses? Buying crypto at the top?

For most people, it's $50k-500k over a lifetime. We're fixing that."

**Minute 2-5: Problem**
"40 million Americans own stocks and crypto. 80% make terrible decisions:
- They panic sell at the bottom
- They FOMO buy at the top
- They ignore tax optimization
- They over-concentrate in winners

Why? Because no one teaches them HOW to make good decisions. Financial advisors cost $5k-50k/year. Robinhood gave them tools but no education."

**Minute 5-8: Solution**
"We built an FQ Score - like a credit score, but for financial decision-making. It measures three things:
1. Knowledge (do you understand tax-loss harvesting?)
2. Discipline (do you stick to your plan?)
3. Wisdom (do you learn from mistakes?)

We gamify improvement through Duolingo-style exercises, and we use on-device AI to coach you in real-time.

[DEMO: Show FQ dashboard, daily briefing, behavioral alert]"

**Minute 8-10: Traction**
"We soft-launched 3 months ago:
- 250 beta users
- $8k MRR
- 42% D30 retention
- NPS 62
- Users improving their FQ by 120 points in 90 days

That's Duolingo-level engagement for finance."

**Minute 10-12: Market**
"TAM is $2.4 billion - 40M investors × $60/year subscription. Our beachhead is 8M high-net-worth millennials who distrust Wall Street but want sophisticated tools.

We're freemium SaaS: Free FQ assessment, $30/month for full platform, $299 iPad device for on-device AI."

**Minute 12-14: Business Model**
"Unit economics:
- CAC: $50 (content marketing)
- LTV: $360 (12 months avg)
- Gross margin: 85%
- Profitable Month 10

[Show graph: LTV/CAC improving as we scale]"

**Minute 14-16: Competitive Moats**
"Four moats:
1. FQ Score becomes the standard (like FICO)
2. Network effects (social leaderboards)
3. Data moat (10M behavioral decisions → better AI)
4. Content moat (500 exercises take 2 years to build)

Wealthfront automates. We educate. Different markets."

**Minute 16-18: The Ask**
"We're raising $1M at $4-6M post to:
- Hire engineering team (scale to 10k users)
- Build content library (50 → 500 exercises)
- Integrate brokerages (Plaid API)

We'll be profitable in Month 10, but want to reinvest into growth."

**Minute 18-20: Vision + Q&A**
"10-year vision: FQ Score is the global standard. 100M users. Taught in high schools. We prevent $1 trillion in wealth destruction.

Warren Buffett has an FQ of 1000. We're democratizing that.

Questions?"

### Handling Objections

**Objection 1: "Why won't people just use Wealthfront/Betterment?"**

**Answer**:
"Wealthfront is automation. We're education. Different jobs to be done.

Analogy: Peloton didn't replace gyms, they created a new category (connected fitness).

We're creating 'connected financial education.' Our users ALSO use Wealthfront - we teach them to use it correctly."

---

**Objection 2: "Financial education has been tried. It doesn't work."**

**Answer**:
"You're right - traditional financial education (books, seminars, online courses) has <5% completion rates.

We're different:
1. Gamification (Duolingo has 80% D7 retention)
2. Real-time coaching (AI catches mistakes BEFORE you make them)
3. FQ Score (measurable progress, social proof)

Our 42% D30 retention proves people stick with us."

---

**Objection 3: "How do you compete with free (YouTube, Reddit)?"**

**Answer**:
"YouTube is fragmented. Reddit is anonymous (no accountability).

We're the 'Nike Run Club' of finance - free alternatives exist, but people pay for structure, community, and accountability.

Our FQ Score gives you a number to improve. YouTube can't do that."

---

**Objection 4: "Regulatory risk - are you giving investment advice?"**

**Answer**:
"No. We're education, not advice. Legal distinction:

Advice: 'You should buy AAPL'
Education: 'Here's how covered calls work, and here's how to evaluate if AAPL is a good candidate'

We never say 'buy this stock.' We teach frameworks for decision-making. No RIA license required."

---

**Objection 5: "Why iPad only? You're limiting TAM."**

**Answer**:
"Phase 1: iPad (premium positioning, on-device AI works)
Phase 2: iPhone (compromise on AI quality, still works)
Phase 3: Web (cloud AI for everyone)

iPad is our beachhead - HNW users who value privacy. Then we expand down-market."

---

**Objection 6: "What if OpenAI/ChatGPT builds this?"**

**Answer**:
"ChatGPT is general-purpose. We're specialized.

Moat:
1. FQ Score algorithm (proprietary)
2. Exercise database (500 scenarios, 2 years to build)
3. Behavioral data (10M decisions → better coaching)
4. Community (leaderboards, accountability)

ChatGPT could explain tax-loss harvesting. They can't gamify your improvement or track your FQ over time."

---

**Objection 7: "Valuation seems high for pre-revenue."**

**Answer**:
"We're not pre-revenue - we're at $8k MRR with 3 months of effort.

Comparables:
- Duolingo pre-seed (2012): $3M valuation, 100k users, $0 revenue
- Robinhood pre-seed (2013): $6M valuation, 0 users, $0 revenue

We're at $4-6M post with 250 users, $8k MRR, and proven engagement (42% D30).

Fair valuation for comparable traction."

## Closing Thoughts

**Timeline to Close $1M**:
- Weeks 1-4: Map warm intros, prepare deck
- Weeks 5-8: Outreach (30+ investors contacted)
- Weeks 9-12: Meetings (15-20 pitches)
- Weeks 13-16: Negotiate terms, close lead investor
- Week 16: Wire transfers, celebrate

**Success Rate**:
- Contact 50 investors → 20 meetings → 5 term sheets → 1-2 close

**Red Flags for Investors**:
- Avoid investors asking for >25% equity (too dilutive)
- Avoid investors demanding board seat at pre-seed (too early)
- Avoid investors with no fintech/consumer expertise (can't help)

**Green Flags**:
- Investor responds within 48 hours (they're excited)
- Investor intro you to portfolio companies (testing product-market fit)
- Investor offers term sheet before deck meeting (very bullish)
