HOW TO COMPILE YOUR PAPERS TO PDF
===================================

STEP 1: Close and Restart Terminal
-----------------------------------
1. Close this terminal/Claude Code window completely
2. This refreshes the PATH to include MiKTeX


STEP 2: Run the Batch File
---------------------------
Open a new terminal and run:

   cd C:\ai\asicForTranAI\2025-3.5bit-groq-mvp\paper
   compile_papers.bat

Or:
   1. Open File Explorer
   2. Navigate to: C:\ai\asicForTranAI\2025-3.5bit-groq-mvp\paper
   3. Double-click "compile_papers.bat"


STEP 3: Wait for Compilation
-----------------------------
The batch file will:
- Check if pdflatex is installed
- Compile paper.tex (twice for cross-references)
- Compile supplementary.tex (twice)
- Show you the results
- Ask if you want to clean up auxiliary files

This takes about 2-3 minutes.


WHAT YOU'LL GET
---------------
After successful compilation:

  paper.pdf              - Main paper (ready for submission)
  supplementary.pdf      - Supplementary materials

Both files will be in:
  C:\ai\asicForTranAI\2025-3.5bit-groq-mvp\paper\


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Problem: "pdflatex not found"
Solution:
  - Restart your computer to refresh all environment variables
  - Or manually add to PATH:
    C:\Program Files\MiKTeX\miktex\bin\x64

Problem: Compilation errors
Solution:
  - Check the .log files for details
  - Missing packages will auto-install if you enabled that option
  - Open MiKTeX Console to manually install packages if needed


ALTERNATIVE: Manual Commands
-----------------------------
If you prefer to run commands manually:

cd C:\ai\asicForTranAI\2025-3.5bit-groq-mvp\paper

pdflatex paper.tex
pdflatex paper.tex

pdflatex supplementary.tex
pdflatex supplementary.tex


NEXT STEPS
----------
Once you have the PDFs:

1. Review paper.pdf for formatting
2. Review supplementary.pdf for completeness
3. Submit to ICML 2025 (deadline: February 1, 2025)
