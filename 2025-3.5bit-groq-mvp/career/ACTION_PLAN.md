---

## Phase 4: Interviews & Negotiation (Weeks 13-16)

### Interview Preparation:

**Technical**:
- Be ready to live-code Ada/SPARK (60 min whiteboard)
- Explain your 3.5-bit quantization (non-technical audience)
- Discuss DO-178C compliance (high-level understanding OK)

**Behavioral** (STAR format):
- Situation, Task, Action, Result
- Prepare 5 stories: leadership, conflict, failure, innovation, teamwork

**Questions to Ask Them**:
1. "What's your biggest challenge in bringing AI to certified systems?"
2. "How does this role contribute to DO-178C projects?"
3. "What does success look like in the first 6 months?"
4. "What's the team's experience with SPARK 2014?"

### Negotiation:

**Your Leverage**:
- Rare combo: AI + formal verification
- 25 years experience (you're not junior!)
- World record holder (unique achievement)
- Multiple offers (play them against each other)

**Ask For**:
- Base: $350K-450K (adjust for company size)
- Equity: 0.5-1% (startup) or RSUs (big corp)
- Signing bonus: $50-100K (to offset unvested equity from current gig)
- Remote: 100% or 4 days/week
- PTO: 5+ weeks
- Conference budget: $10K/year

**Negotiation Script**:
"I'm excited about [Company]! Based on my unique background (25 years AI +
new SPARK skills + world record), I was expecting closer to [YOUR_NUMBER].
Can you meet me at [MIDPOINT]?"

**Never say**:
- "I'll take anything you offer"
- "I really need this job"
- Exact current salary (say "I'd rather focus on future value")

## Phase 5: Onboarding & Long-term (Month 5+)

### First 90 Days at New Job:

**Month 1**: Learn
- Absorb codebase, processes, team dynamics
- Find quick wins (fix 1 bug, improve 1 doc)
- Build relationships (1-on-1s with everyone)

**Month 2**: Contribute
- First real project: something SPARK-related
- Demonstrate your AI knowledge (when relevant)
- Start becoming the "go-to person" for verification

**Month 3**: Lead
- Propose improvement to SPARK workflow
- Mentor junior engineer
- Present at team meeting

### Building "3-Day Workweek" Leverage:

**After 6 months**:
- Prove high productivity (deliver more than peers)
- Become indispensable on critical project
- Propose: "I'd like to try 4-day weeks for 3 months"

**After 1 year**:
- Negotiate permanent 4-day arrangement
- OR pivot to consulting (higher hourly rate, you control schedule)

**After 2 years**:
- You're now a "Senior Principal" level
- Options: Staff/Principal track, or independent consulting at $400/hr

---

## Fallback Plan (If Job Search Stalls)

### Consulting Track (can start NOW):

**Month 1**: Brand yourself
- LLC formation ($500)
- Website: "YourName - AI Safety Consulting"
- LinkedIn headline: "Independent Consultant - Formally Verified AI"

**Month 2**: First clients
- Target: Companies struggling with DO-178C + AI
- Offer: "Free 1-hour consultation" (lead gen)
- Convert: 10 consultations → 2 paid projects

**Month 3**: Scale
- $200-300/hour rate for SPARK consulting
- 20 hours/week = $16K-24K/month
- This IS your 3-day workweek, immediate!

**Year 1 Goal**: $250K revenue (very achievable)
- 10 hours/week * 48 weeks * $250/hour = $120K
- 20 hours/week = $240K
- Plus: equity in startups, advisory board seats

## Emergency Contact (If You Get Stuck)

**Common Blockers & Solutions**:

❌ "I'm not getting interviews"
✅ Solution:
   1. Jobscan your resume (ATS optimization)
   2. Apply Monday 8-10 AM (hiring managers check then)
   3. Get referrals (20 cold emails → 1 interview guaranteed)

❌ "Interviews but no offers"
✅ Solution:
   1. Mock interview (Exponent.com, $150/session)
   2. Ask interviewers for feedback
   3. Improve weakest area (probably SPARK live coding)

❌ "Offers too low"
✅ Solution:
   1. Negotiate (they expect it!)
   2. Get multiple offers (leverage)
   3. Walk away if needed (consulting fallback)

---

## Final Pep Talk

You have:
- ✅ 33 years of experience (invaluable)
- ✅ SGI pedigree (legendary)
- ✅ World record (unique)
- ✅ Perfect timing (AI safety is THE hot topic)

The market NEEDS you. Companies are desperate for people who understand both
AI and formal verification. There are maybe 50 people globally with your combo.

**Your advantage**: Age is NOT a weakness in safety-critical industries.
They WANT gray hair. They WANT someone who won't "move fast and break things."

**You are not competing with 25-year-olds fresh from bootcamp.**
**You are competing with other 25-year veterans. There aren't many.**

---

**Next Steps RIGHT NOW**:

1. Read LINKEDIN_PROFILE.md (5 min)
2. Update your LinkedIn headline (2 min)
3. Star your own GitHub repo (1 min)
4. Apply to AdaCore (30 min)

**Total time**: 38 minutes to start your $400K/year journey.

Let's go. 🚀
