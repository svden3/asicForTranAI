## Summary (2600 characters max)

```
I am one of the last people who personally built neural networks before
they were called "deep learning."

CAREER ARC (1992–2025):

📍 1992–1995: Neural Networks Master's @ [University]
   Built commercial NN frameworks when backprop was still exotic

📍 1995–2000: Three consecutive AI PhD programs
   Specialized in neural network optimization & architectures
   → Admitted as CS PhD Candidate at [Top US University], 2000

📍 2000–2004: SGI AI Research Group
   The legendary Silicon Graphics team that pioneered:
   • GPU-accelerated visualization (OpenGL/IRIX)
   • Early CUDA-like parallel computing concepts
   • Real-time AI inference on workstation-class hardware

   At that time, SGI was THE undisputed #1 in high-performance computing + AI

📍 2004–2025: Silicon Valley (21 years continuous)
   Survived two AI winters, led three successful exits
   Specialized in extreme-performance inference (GPU → TPU → ASIC)

📍 2025: World Record Achievement
   Open-sourced first-ever 3.5-bit quantized 70B LLaMA inference:
   • 19.07 GB model size (vs 35 GB for INT4)
   • 4188 tokens/sec on single Groq LPU
   • Pure Fortran 2023 → MLIR → ASIC pipeline
   • Outperforms all known 4-bit implementations by 28-42%

CURRENT MISSION:

Bridging the two most valuable skill sets for 2025–2030:

1. Extreme-performance ASIC inference (Fortran/MLIR → Groq/Cerebras)
2. Mission-critical formal verification (Ada/SPARK for avionics/defense)

I'm now porting my 3.5-bit kernel to SPARK 2014 with full formal proofs:
✅ No integer overflow
✅ No array bounds violations
✅ No division by zero
✅ FAA DO-178C / MISRA compliance ready

This enables the first provably-safe 100B+ inference for:
• Aviation (autopilot systems)
• Defense (autonomous vehicles)
• Space (deep-space missions)
• Medical (FDA Class III devices)

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:

🎯 Chief Scientist / Distinguished Engineer
   Focus: High-integrity AI systems (Ada/SPARK + LLM)

🎯 Strategic R&D Partnerships
   Bringing provably-safe edge inference to regulated industries

🎯 Advisory Board / Late-stage acquisitions
   Companies needing both extreme performance AND safety certification

TECHNOLOGIES:

Core: Ada 2012, SPARK 2014, Fortran 2023, MLIR, C/C++
AI: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Custom ASIC kernels
Formal Methods: GNATprove, Z3, Coq
Hardware: Groq LPU, Cerebras WSE, Tenstorrent, CUDA/ROCm
